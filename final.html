<h3>Final Reflection</h3>

<p>Final report and reflection
Your final report (even though it's called a report, more accurately it is a final version of your website) should include the following elements:
All the material from the previous deliverables, edited to bring them up to date.  Sections that are no longer relevant can be removed.
A final refinement of the design, including any changes since the previous iteration and an explanation of why the change occurred (edit your "Design" section of your website with this information).
An analysis of the outcome.  Did you achieve your minimum deliverable?  If not, why not?  Did you achieve your maximum deliverable?  If so, what went right (that is, why was the project easier to complete than you thought)?
A reflection on your design.  What was the best decision that you made?  What would you do differently next time?
A reflection on the division of labor.  Were you able to divide the project in a way that allowed the members of the team to work independently and then integrate their work into a whole?
Bug report: what was the most difficult bug you had to find? How did the bug manifest itself?  What did you do to find it? How long did it take?  What was the cause of the problem?  In retrospect, what could you have done to find it faster?
Optional: a video demonstrating your software.  You might want to record your demo using a software package that does screen capture, shows mouse clicks and keyboard input, and records your voice.  This video will be a perfect addition to your professional portfolio.

Turning in your final report and reflection: to turn in your final report and reflection you should: (1) edit the "Design" section of your website with any new information related to your design (see second bullet point) and (2) Create a new section of the website called "Final Report and Reflection" with the other information requested above.</p>
