<h3>Project Proposal </h3>
<h3>Pratool Gadtaula, Casey Alvarado, and Jay Woo</h3>

<p>Our project is a stand-alone, Software Design game.  We will develop a virtual Go game that can have two players: two human or a human and a computer. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">Go</a> is a game that originated in China 2,500 years ago, it emphasizes balance and judgment.
Our first iteration will include our minimum deliverable that will be comprised of a two-player interactive version of Go with a graphical user interface. Secondly, we will create a basic type of artificial intelligence that the computer would use against a human opponent. This AI will predict the best possible move that the computer could make given that the human opponent makes the best move in their favor. Thirdly, we hope to improve upon our logic strategies with more complex algorithms and further refine the interface of our game.</p>

<p>We could go above and beyond the minimum deliverable by incorporating the basics of machine learning into our game. We would allow the computer to make random decisions and play out a game. Based on the previous unsuccessful outcomes, the computer would learn what not to do from its own previous mistakes to play a decent game against a human. Accomplishing and successfully implementing this type of artificial intelligence would be improbable, but this would further our learning objectives of learning new games.</p>

<p>Our first step is to play Go in order to understand the basic rules and different strategies employed by more experienced players.</p>

<p>The biggest problem we foresee is implementing artificial intelligence algorithms to compute the best move for the computer to play. Taking a different approach, another dilemma we envision is comprehending machine learning in order to apply useful procedures that will allow the computer to make better judgements when playing against a human. </p>
